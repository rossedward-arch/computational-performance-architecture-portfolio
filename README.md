# computational-performance-architecture-portfolio
Computational architectural design portfolio exploring parametric modelling, building performance simulation, machine learning surrogate models, and interpretable spatial feedback for early-stage urban and low-carbon building design workflows.
# Computational Performance Architecture Portfolio

This portfolio showcases my **interdisciplinary work at the intersection of architecture, computational design, and building performance analysis**. It highlights projects in energy simulation, parametric & generative design, machine learning surrogates, interpretable AI feedback, and integrated computational workflows for architecture.

It demonstrates my skills in **Python scripting, ML modeling, parametric automation, simulation integration, and spatially-aware design reasoning**, providing a foundation for both research and professional practice.
