# Machine Learning Surrogates

This folder contains **machine learning surrogate models** for predicting building performance:

- Regression models, neural networks, graph-based representations.
- Surrogate-assisted performance estimation for rapid design feedback.
- Evaluation metrics (RMSE, R², NMBE) and spatial interpretability analysis.

## Projects

- **Project Name:** Brief description of surrogate modelling approach.
- **Project Name:** Brief description.

## How to Use

Each project includes Python scripts and notebooks. Activate the Conda environment and run the notebooks to train or test models.
